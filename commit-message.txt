Implement TimescaleDB compression policy tools (TOOL-4)

This commit implements the compression policy tools for TimescaleDB integration:

- Added Enable/Disable compression operations
- Added Add/Remove compression policy operations
- Added Get compression settings operation
- Added tests for all compression policy operations
- Updated TIMESCALEDB_IMPLEMENTATION.md to reflect completion

Compression policies in TimescaleDB allow for automatic compression of older data chunks, which significantly reduces storage requirements while maintaining efficient query performance.
