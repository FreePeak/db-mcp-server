## 📖 Usage

### Integrating with Cursor Edit and AI Agents

DB MCP Server creates a powerful bridge between your databases and AI assistants in Cursor Edit, enabling AI-driven database operations with full context awareness. Configure your Cursor settings in `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "db-mcp-server": {
            "url": "http://localhost:9090/sse"
        }
    }
}
```

To leverage AI-powered database operations:

1. Configure and start the DB MCP Server using one of the installation methods above
2. Add the configuration to your Cursor settings
3. Open Cursor and navigate to a SQL or code file
4. The AI assistant now has access to your database schema, relationships, and capabilities
5. Ask the AI to generate, explain, or optimize database queries with full schema awareness
6. Execute AI-generated queries directly from Cursor

The MCP Server enhances AI assistant capabilities with:

- Complete database schema understanding
- Relationship-aware query generation
- Intelligent query optimization recommendations
- Error prevention through constraint awareness
- Performance metrics for better suggestions
- Context persistence across multiple operations

### Example AI Interactions

```
# Ask the AI for schema information
"What tables are in the database and how are they related?"

# Request query generation with context
"Create a query to find all orders from customers in California with items over $100"

# Get optimization suggestions
"How can I optimize this query that's taking too long to execute?"

# Request complex data operations
"Help me create a transaction that updates inventory levels when an order is placed"
```

### Custom Tool Registration (Server-side)

```go
// Go example
package main

import (
	"context"
	"db-mcpserver/internal/mcp"
)

func main() {
	// Create a custom database tool that AI agents can discover and use
	queryTool := &mcp.Tool{
		Name:        "dbQuery",
		Description: "Executes read-only SQL queries with parameterized inputs",
		InputSchema: mcp.ToolInputSchema{
			Type: "object",

### Multiple Database Support

DB MCP Server supports connecting to multiple databases simultaneously, allowing AI agents to work across different database systems in a unified way. Each database connection is identified by a unique ID that can be referenced when using database tools.

#### Configuring Multiple Databases

Configure multiple database connections in your `.env` file or environment variables:

```
# Multiple Database Configuration
DB_CONNECTIONS=[
  {
    "id": "mysql1",
    "type": "mysql",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3306,
    "user": "user1",
    "password": "password1",
    "database": "db1"
  },
  {
    "id": "postgres1",
    "type": "postgres",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "user": "user2",
    "password": "password2",
    "database": "db2"
  },
  {
    "id": "mysql2",
    "type": "mysql",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3307,
    "user": "user3",
    "password": "password3",
    "database": "db3"
  }
]
```

#### Viewing Connected Databases

Use the `showConnectedDatabases` tool to see all connected databases with their status and connection information:

```json
// Get information about all connected databases
{
  "name": "showConnectedDatabases"
}
```

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "mysql1",
    "type": "mysql",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3306,
    "database": "db1",
    "status": "connected",
    "latency": "1.2ms"
  },
  {
    "id": "postgres1",
    "type": "postgres",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "db2",
    "status": "connected",
    "latency": "0.8ms"
  }
]
```

#### Specifying Database for Operations

When using database tools, you must specify which database to use with the `databaseId` parameter (not `database`):

```json
// Query a specific database by ID
{
  "name": "dbQuery",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "postgres1",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10"
  }
}

// Execute statement on a specific database
{
  "name": "dbExecute",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "mysql2",
    "statement": "UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = 5"
  }
}

// Get schema from a specific database
{
  "name": "dbSchema",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "mysql1",
    "component": "tables"
  }
}
```

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Always use `databaseId` (not `database`) as the parameter name when specifying which database to use. This is required for all database operation tools.

If your configuration has only one database connection, you must still provide the database ID that matches the ID in your configuration.

### Database Schema Explorer Tool

The MCP Server includes an AI-aware Database Schema Explorer tool (`dbSchema`) that provides AI models with complete database structural knowledge:

```json
// Get all tables in the database - enables AI to understand available data entities
{
  "name": "dbSchema",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "mysql1",
    "component": "tables"
  }
}

// Get columns for a specific table - gives AI detailed field information
{
  "name": "dbSchema",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "postgres1",
    "component": "columns",
    "table": "users"
  }
}

// Get relationships for a specific table or all relationships - helps AI understand data connections
{
  "name": "dbSchema",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "mysql1",
    "component": "relationships",
    "table": "orders"
  }
}

// Get the full database schema - provides AI with comprehensive structural context
{
  "name": "dbSchema",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "postgres1",
    "component": "full"
  }
}
```

The Schema Explorer supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, automatically adapting to your configured database type and providing AI with the appropriate contextual information.

### Visual Query Builder Tool

The MCP Server includes a powerful Visual Query Builder tool (`dbQueryBuilder`) that helps you construct SQL queries with syntax validation:

```json
// Validate a SQL query for syntax errors
{
  "name": "dbQueryBuilder",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "mysql1",
    "action": "validate",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active'"
  }
}

// Build a SQL query from components
{
  "name": "dbQueryBuilder",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "postgres1",
    "action": "build",
    "components": {
      "select": ["id", "name", "email"],
      "from": "users",
      "where": [
        {
          "column": "status",
          "operator": "=",
          "value": "active"
        }
      ],
      "orderBy": [
        {
          "column": "name",
          "direction": "ASC"
        }
      ],
      "limit": 10
    }
  }
}

// Analyze a SQL query for potential issues and performance
{
  "name": "dbQueryBuilder",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "mysql1",
    "action": "analyze",
    "query": "SELECT u.*, o.* FROM users u JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id WHERE u.status = 'active' AND o.created_at > '2023-01-01'"
  }
}
```

Example response from a query build operation:

```json
{
  "query": "SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE status = 'active' ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 10",
  "components": {
    "select": ["id", "name", "email"],
    "from": "users",
    "where": [{
      "column": "status",
      "operator": "=",
      "value": "active"
    }],
    "orderBy": [{
      "column": "name",
      "direction": "ASC"
    }],
    "limit": 10
  },
  "validation": {
    "valid": true,
    "query": "SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE status = 'active' ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 10"
  }
}
```

The Query Builder supports:
- SELECT statements with multiple columns
- JOIN operations (inner, left, right, full)
- WHERE conditions with various operators
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- ORDER BY with sorting direction
- LIMIT and OFFSET for pagination
- Syntax validation and error suggestions
- Query complexity analysis

### Performance Analyzer Tool

The MCP Server includes a powerful Performance Analyzer tool (`dbPerformanceAnalyzer`) that identifies slow queries and provides optimization suggestions:

```json
// Get slow queries that exceed the configured threshold
{
  "name": "dbPerformanceAnalyzer",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "mysql1",
    "action": "getSlowQueries",
    "limit": 5
  }
}

// Get metrics for all tracked queries sorted by average duration
{
  "name": "dbPerformanceAnalyzer",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "postgres1",
    "action": "getMetrics",
    "limit": 10
  }
}

// Analyze a specific query for optimization opportunities
{
  "name": "dbPerformanceAnalyzer",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "mysql1",
    "action": "analyzeQuery",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM orders JOIN users ON orders.user_id = users.id WHERE orders.status = 'pending'"
  }
}

// Reset all collected performance metrics
{
  "name": "dbPerformanceAnalyzer",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "postgres1",
    "action": "reset"
  }
}

// Set the threshold for identifying slow queries (in milliseconds)
{
  "name": "dbPerformanceAnalyzer",
  "arguments": {
    "databaseId": "mysql1",
    "action": "setThreshold",
    "threshold": 300
  }
}
```

Example response from a performance analysis:

```json
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM orders JOIN users ON orders.user_id = users.id WHERE orders.status = 'pending'",
  "suggestions": [
    "Avoid using SELECT * - specify only the columns you need",
    "Verify that ORDER BY columns are properly indexed",
    "Consider adding appropriate indexes for frequently queried columns"
  ]
}
```

Example response from getting slow queries:

```json
{
  "metrics": [
    {
      "query": "SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE status = ?",
      "count": 15,
      "totalDuration": "2.5s",
      "minDuration": "120ms",
      "maxDuration": "750ms",
      "avgDuration": "166ms",
      "lastExecuted": "2025-06-15T14:23:45Z"
    },
    {
      "query": "SELECT order_id, SUM(amount) FROM order_items GROUP BY order_id",
      "count": 8,
      "totalDuration": "1.2s",
      "minDuration": "110ms",
      "maxDuration": "580ms",
      "avgDuration": "150ms",
      "lastExecuted": "2025-06-15T14:20:12Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 2,
  "threshold": "100ms"
}
```

The Performance Analyzer automatically tracks all query executions and provides:
- Identification of slow-performing queries
- Query execution metrics (count, min, max, average durations)
- Pattern-based query analysis
- Optimization suggestions
- Performance trend monitoring
- Configurable slow query thresholds

### Database Transactions Tool

For operations that require transaction support, use the `dbTransaction` tool:
